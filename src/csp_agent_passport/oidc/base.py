# emitted `acr` URI is whatever the CSP happens to send — typically the
# canonical NIST `…/ial/N` form, sometimes the legacy IAF `…/loa/N` URIs that
# some providers still emit for historical reasons. The translation table
# below collapses both into IAL semantics; the rest of the codebase only ever
# sees the AssuranceLevels output.

# DESIGN NOTE — conservative legacy-LOA translation
# --------------------------------------------------
# `…/loa/3` is the legacy IAF "identity verified" tier (documents proofed,
# MFA required). In NIST 800-63-3 vocabulary that's IAL-2 + AAL-2, *not*
# IAL-3 — IAL-3 requires in-person supervised proofing that legacy LOA-3
# tiers do not perform. We translate `…/loa/3` to IAL-2 so a downstream
# verifier with `require_ial=3` correctly rejects these tokens.
#
# To extend this for a CSP that emits other ACR URIs, write your own
# `AcrMapping` and pass it to `IDTokenValidator(acr_mapping=…)`. Do not edit
# the entries below in place; the conservative defaults must stay
# conservative or every other deployment's IAL-3 policy silently weakens.
